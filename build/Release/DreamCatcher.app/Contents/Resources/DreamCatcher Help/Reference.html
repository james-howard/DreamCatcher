                        DreamCatcher obeys robots.txt 
                        but does not currently respect HTML robot meta tags placed in the head 
                        of an HTML document. You can contain where DreamCatcher looks using the 
                        robots.txt web standard. DreamCatcher never follows links to 
                        hosts outside of the one you have specified. For more information about 
                        using robots.txt check out

                        Whether you are using a custom script or the provided ErrorHandler.scpt script, what the script returns
                        dictates how DreamCatcher responds. If the script returns <span class="UI">true</span> DreamCatcher assumes
                        the error has been fixed so it removes the word from the misspellings list and reloads the page. However, if the script
                        returns <span class="UI">false</span> DreamCatcher assumes the error has not been fixed so the word is not removed
                        from the misspellings list and the page is not reloaded.</span></div>

                       	how it works. To open it simply double-click the file in the Finder. Additionally, Apple's Script Editor
