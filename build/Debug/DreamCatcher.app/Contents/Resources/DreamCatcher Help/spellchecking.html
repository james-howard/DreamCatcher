                        misspelled words are listed and a web view of the page is shown 
                        below. Select a word to see it highlighted in the web view. If DreamCatcher 
                        has any suggestions for correcting the error they are listed below each 
                        word. DreamCatcher uses the Apple system spell checker to search for 
                        spelling errors and provide correction suggestions.

						tag to provide links to your framed content that DreamCatcher (and other user agents that do not support
