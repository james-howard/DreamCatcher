        <h2>Correcting Errors</h2>
        
                        <div class="item "><span class="">DreamCatcher allows you to not only identify spelling errors
                        in a Web site but also correct them using Applescripts. DreamCatcher comes with an example script that is set up 
                        for correcting errors using BBEdit 8.  However, you can modify the script to use any
                        editor (that supports Applescript) that you like. For more information refer to <a href="preferences.html">Preferences</a>. Please keep
                        in mind that correcting errors in DreamCatcher is an advanced feature that should only be used if you are familiar with Applescript
                        and advanced Web development.</span></div>
                        
                        <div class="item "><span class="">To correct spelling errors found by DreamCatcher, you must first make sure that the error handling script
                        is set up correctly and is loaded into the DreamCatcher preferences. The sample error handler script allows you to make corrections to Web sites stored
                        locally on your machine in the <span class="UI">/Library/WebServer/Documents</span> directory.</span></div>
                        
                 		<div class="item "><span class="">To set up the error handling script:</span></div>

                        <div class="item Box">                            
                        <ol><li><div class="item "><span class="">Locate the <span class="UI">ErrorHandler.scpt</span> Apple Script that downloaded with 
                        DreamCatcher.</span> </div></li>

                            <li><div class="item "><span class="">Drag the ErrorHandler.scpt Apple script into the Script Well at the bottom of the DreamCatcher
                            preferences pane.</span>  </div></li>
                            <li><div class="item "><span class="">Turn on Personal Web Sharing in the Apple System Preferences.</span></div></li>
                        </div>
                        
                        <div class="item "><span class=""><span class="Bold">Note:</span>You can drag a custom script into DreamCatcher preferences if you want
                        to modify how DreamCatcher corrects errors.</span></div>
                        
                        <div class="item"><span class="">After you have the error handling script set up correctly, type the Web address for a Web site located in the 
                        <span class="UI">/Library/WebServer/Documents</span> directory (typically http://localhost). 
                        From the results list, right-click a misspelled word and select <span class="UI">
                        Fix Misspelling</span>. BBEdit opens the file with the misspelled word highlighted. Select the correct word in the <span class="UI">
                        Choose Word</span>
                        dialog box and click <span class="UI">OK</span>. 
                        You can then select to Replace All to correct all instances in the file, Replace One to just change that particular
                        instance, or Replace None to cancel the correction. After the correction is made, the file is saved and closed and you 
                        return to DreamCatcher.
                        Keep in mind that all of these actions are dictated by the error handler script and can be modified as you see fit. For some tips about
                        how the script works refer to the <a href="reference.html">Reference</a> section.</span></div>

                        however, as always, you can modify the error handling script to match the URL re-writing you are using.</span></div>
