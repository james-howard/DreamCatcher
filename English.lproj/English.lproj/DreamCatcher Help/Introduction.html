<p class="p2"><b>Welcome to DreamCatcher</b></p>
<p class="p2">A nightmare of both novice and advanced web developers is finding a misspelling in their work. 
What is worse is a client or an end user finding a misspelled word. You lose credibility and just generally look bad. 
The problem is that it is difficult to spell check a Web site that is where DreamCatcher comes in.</p>
<p>
<p class="p2">DreamCatcher is a nifty utility to check for spelling errors on a Web site. DreamCatcher moves through 
the pages of a given site checking both the text on the site as well as the text of linked Microsoft Word and Adobe 
PDF documents. DreamCatcher makes it easy to find where the misspellings are located on your site by highlighting the 
words in a web viewer. You can also ignore commonly used words or add them to a dictionary. 
Advanced users can use Applescript to integrate DreamCatcher with their development environment
to fix spelling errors.</p>
