Version 1.2.1
* Two html parsers are now available: the classic regex based DreamCatcher
  parser and now the new XML Tidy based parser.  The default remains the
  DreamCatcher parser, but you can switch over to Tidy via the preferences.

  Tidy is stricter and probably more "correct" than the old DreamCatcher 
  parser but as a consequence of that it does not handle malformed pages 
  as well.  Both parsers seem to be about the same speed, but Tidy seems 
  to use less memory so Tidy might be the better choice if you need to scan
  huge pages.

Version 1.2
* DreamCatcher now has the ability to not just find misspellings, but to fix them
  too, through the help of an Applescript handler.  A sample handler
  is included that integrates with BBEdit and Mac OS X's personal web sharing.
  See the built in documentation (under the Help menu in DreamCatcher) for more
  information on this feature.
* The final spellchecking step is now run in a background thread.
* DreamCatcher is now built as a universal binary. Update: I tried it on
  an Intel mac and it does work :).

Version 1.1.1
* Added preference to set default text encoding to use when the web server
  does not return a Content-Encoding header and the content is not in the
  assumed format of ISO-8859-1.  This fixes the "DreamCatcher
  doesn't find any pages and doesn't return any errors" problem.

Version 1.1
* Added ability to ignore or add words.
* Added preferences dialog that controls added words list as well
  as search depth.
* Added toggle to see list of all URLs found during spidering, not just
  the ones that contain misspellings.
* Added support for file:// type URLs.
* HTML entities are now handled correctly.
* Various and sundry fixes for issues that arose in real world usage.

Version 1.0
